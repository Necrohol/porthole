0.2:

     * Emerge sync has been temporarily disabled due to technical problems.

     * Fixed bug 883881 - Icons will now refresh after an emerge.

     * Doesn't show Unmerge button unless the selected package is installed.

     * Removed sudo stuff; users will have to run porthole as root for
       emerge functionality.

     * Added porthole.desktop menu entry.

     * Allow installing without an X server running.

     * Added options --fetchonly and --verbose.

     * There is an Upgradable Packages view. You can select packages
       to upgrade. Packages in the world file should be selected by
       default.

     * Icons for upgradable packages are no longer shown because it
       was too slow.

     * Settings and window positions are saved to $HOME/.porthole/prefs.
