0.4.0:

    * updated to use the new & pre portage-2.0.51 as the world file is relocated
      as of 2.0.51

    * Added an internal progress bar in a second statusbar on the main window.
      I will probably merge the 2 statusbars in the future, depending on feedback.
      The new progress bar does not tie up the gui from any other interation like
      the dialog box did until it was closed.
      
    * Advanced emerge toolbar option & dialog giving fairly easy access to most
      advanced emrge features & options.  TOC worked hard on this one and I think
      he did a great job on it.
      
    * Help is now working with a good start on the basics and help on the advanced
      emerge options.
      
    * The web browser is now opened from a threaded function call so that it does not
      tie up the gui untill it is closed.  It also is used to open a browser to the
      help files that are now in porthole.
      
    * Database reloads can be manually activated by menu option.  Good for when an
      emerge has taken place independantly from an open porthole session.
      
     * Portage modules imported into porthole can be manually reloaded in order for
       porthole to see changes in /etc/make.conf, etc.  Also usefull if portage was
       updated to a new version .  It will reload the new version just emerged.
       
     * Added pycrash detection and inclusion into porthole.  Can be very usefull for
       debugging.
       
     * Selectable upgrades only or standard upgrade/downgrade upgrades list selection

     * Intermittent autoscroll bug now fixed.
     
     * Porthole now uses a semaphore system to prevent collisions accessing or modifying
       variables by different/threaded program modules, functions.   It has helped prevent
       many of the crashes/segfaults.
       
     * gettext internationalization support now started.  Most text strings are now marked,
       readying for full translation/localization.

     * improved terminal output, so that wget, etc. display their progress bar, etc.
     
     * numerous other bug fixes.
     
     * Changed the default window size to something quite small.  For those that start porthole
       in lower resolutions.  It remembers any size changes between sessions anyway.

     * Added  a -h, --help option to portholes command line interface

0.3.2:  Did not make it to an actual release

    * Combination bugfix & feature improvement release

    * The version sorting routine has been re-written again, portage is/has just
      changed it's version comparison code.  Also the code I released in -0.3.1
      also failed badly for a few odd version strings.

    * The hyperlinks for home pages has been patched to fix  multiple homepage listings
      in the summary view.  Thanks to jonathanl for this patch.

    * the terminal process view will show the download progress almost like it would in
      a normal terminal.

    * The browser opens from a threaded function now so that the rest of porthole
      will no longer be frozen until the browser is closed.  It also now allows multiple
      pages to be opened.

    * The gtk horizontal pane bug is now caught and corrected as porthole opens.

    * On completion of a terminal task the main porthole db is now reloaded without
      disrupting the current view.  The package being viewed is reloaded automatically.
      The upgrades view is the only one that requires a disruptive rebuild.  Sorry, I
      could not get it to work non-disruptively.  I believe it is due to the checkboxes.

    * The settings menu now has the "ALLOW DOWNGRADES" (--upgradeonly) setting (opposite
      to the flag setting) to help fix some package upgrade issues.  Be careful with it's
      setting as it can sometimes change expected emerge behavior when not upgrading packages.

    * USE flags are now displayed with a +/- as well as being colored to show their current
      setting.   Original feature patch submitted by jonathanl.

    * One annoying bug remains in the autoscroll code that causes quirky behavior.
      I have been thru my code, testing, and have concluded that it is a gtk bug in
      the scrollbar code.

0.3.1:

     * This release is primarily a bugfix release.  There have been quite a
       few bugfixes due to submisissions from users and our own testing.

       Thank you to all those that have helped make this release a good one.

     * Kill/Resume has been fixed to work correctly.  Porthole now sends a
       <ctrl>C to the running process to allow it to quit gracefully, so
       emerge can save any info it needs to resume.

     * A new "Resume" option has been added, "Skip Queue item", to skip a
       killed emerge sitting in the queue so that you can continue with the
       remaining entries in the queue.

     * Killed processes now send the callback signal to the main window so that
       any succefully emerged/unmerged packages will show in the change.

     * You can now double click on a line in any of the filtered views tabs and it
       will bring you to that line in the process view tab.  It will attempt to
       place the line in the center of the process view tab.

     * A new portage compliant sort routine for all the available ebuilds.
       It now will sort correctly every time (I Hope).  It will lengthen
       version strings to the same length (# of subversions [x.x.x]).
       All version numbers are formattted to the same length with leading
       zeros so that they can be correctly sorted alphabetically.

     * Dependacy display bugs have been fixed.

     * several bugs dealing with greyed out text/menus/icons have been fixed.

     * We have renamed a few things that were causing some confusion.   The
       "Info" tab was renamed to "Summary" to better reflect its contents.
       The menu item "Save As Log" ==> "Save Log As".
       The "Process Terminated" message is now "Process Complete".

     * the search string will not accept special regular expression characters
       to use in its search.  They will be escaped to be used as text characters.
       That way a search for "c++" will use the search string "c\+\+".
       The ++ would otherwise cause a reg. expression error due to multiple +'s.

     * a little fine tuning to the autoscroll feature.  Note there seems to be a
       bug in gtk that is causing the autocroll sticky feature to snap back to
       fixed point in the buffer at times.  When the process stops you will be able to
       scroll to the end again.
       
       


0.3:

     * Emerge sync is fully functional again.

     * Totally new terminal window, with tabs for information, warnings, a 
       package queue, etc... 

     * Process output is now also color coded to help make certain parts 
       stand out.

     * An emerge queue so that multiple packages can be queued up to be 
       emerged. The queue is fully editable via the new terminal window.

     * Emerges can be resumed after being killed.

     * Preferences are now stored in an XML file.

     * Logs of emerges can be saved and viewed.

     * Custom commands can be run, for example "emerge --no-deps package".

     * A ChangeLog tab has been added in the main window.

     * An Installed Files tab has been added in the main window.

     * Descriptions can be included in searches.

0.2:

     * Emerge sync has been temporarily disabled due to technical problems.

     * Fixed bug 883881 - Icons will now refresh after an emerge.

     * Doesn't show Unmerge button unless the selected package is installed.

     * Removed sudo stuff; users will have to run porthole as root for
       emerge functionality.

     * Added porthole.desktop menu entry.

     * Allow installing without an X server running.

     * Added options --fetchonly and --verbose.

     * There is an Upgradable Packages view. You can select packages
       to upgrade. Packages in the world file should be selected by
       default.

     * Icons for upgradable packages are no longer shown because it
       was too slow.

     * Settings and window positions are saved to $HOME/.porthole/prefs.


0.1:

     * Initial release.
