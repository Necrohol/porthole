0.3.1:

     * This release is primarily a bugfix release.  There have been quite a
       few bugfixes due to submisissions from users and our own testing.

       Thank you to all those that have helped make this release a good one.

     * Kill/Resume has been fixed to work correctly.  Porthole now sends a
       <ctrl>C to the running process to allow it to quit gracefully, so
       emerge can save any info it needs to resume.

     * A new "Resume" option has been added, "Skip Queue item", to skip a
       killed emerge sitting in the queue so that you can continue with the
       remaining entries in the queue.

     * Killed processes now send the callback signal to the main window so that
       any succefully emerged/unmerged packages will show in the change.

     * You can now click on a line in any of the filtered views tabs and it
       will bring you to that line in the process view tab.

     * A new portage compliant sort routine for all the available ebuilds.
       It now will sort correctly every time (I Hope).  It will lengthen
       version strings to the same length (# of subversions [x.x.x]).
       All version numbers are formattted to the same length with leading
       zeros so that they can be correctly sorted alphabetically.

     * Dependacy display bugs have been fixed.

     * several bugs dealing with greyed out text/menus/icons have been fixed.

     * We have renamed a few things that were causing some confusion.   The
       "Info" tab was renamed to "Summary" to better reflect its contents.
       The menu item "Save As Log" ==> "Save Log As".
       The "Process Terminated" message is now "Process Complete".

     * the search string will not accept special regular expression characters
       to use in its search.  They will be escaped to be used as text characters.
       That way a search for "c++" will use the search string "c\+\+".
       The ++ would otherwise cause a reg. expression error due to multiple +'s.

     * a little fine tuning to the autoscroll feature.  Note there seems to be a
       bug in gtk that is causing the autocroll sticky feature to snap back to
       fixed point in the buffer at times.  When the process stops you will be able to
       scroll to the end again.
       
       


0.3:

     * Emerge sync is fully functional again.

     * Totally new terminal window, with tabs for information, warnings, a 
       package queue, etc... 

     * Process output is now also color coded to help make certain parts 
       stand out.

     * An emerge queue so that multiple packages can be queued up to be 
       emerged. The queue is fully editable via the new terminal window.

     * Emerges can be resumed after being killed.

     * Preferences are now stored in an XML file.

     * Logs of emerges can be saved and viewed.

     * Custom commands can be run, for example "emerge --no-deps package".

     * A ChangeLog tab has been added in the main window.

     * An Installed Files tab has been added in the main window.

     * Descriptions can be included in searches.

0.2:

     * Emerge sync has been temporarily disabled due to technical problems.

     * Fixed bug 883881 - Icons will now refresh after an emerge.

     * Doesn't show Unmerge button unless the selected package is installed.

     * Removed sudo stuff; users will have to run porthole as root for
       emerge functionality.

     * Added porthole.desktop menu entry.

     * Allow installing without an X server running.

     * Added options --fetchonly and --verbose.

     * There is an Upgradable Packages view. You can select packages
       to upgrade. Packages in the world file should be selected by
       default.

     * Icons for upgradable packages are no longer shown because it
       was too slow.

     * Settings and window positions are saved to $HOME/.porthole/prefs.
