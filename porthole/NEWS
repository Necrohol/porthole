0.3:

     * Emerge sync is fully functional again.

     * Totally new terminal window, with tabs for information, warnings, a 
       package queue, etc... 

     * Process output is now also color coded to help make certain parts 
       stand out.

     * An emerge queue so that multiple packages can be queued up to be 
       emerged. The queue is fully editable via the new terminal window.

     * Emerges can be resumed after being killed.

     * Preferences are now stored in an XML file.

     * Logs of emerges can be saved and viewed.

     * Custom commands can be run, for example "emerge --no-deps package".

     * A ChangeLog tab has been added in the main window.

     * An Installed Files tab has been added in the main window.

     * Descriptions can be included in searches.

0.2:

     * Emerge sync has been temporarily disabled due to technical problems.

     * Fixed bug 883881 - Icons will now refresh after an emerge.

     * Doesn't show Unmerge button unless the selected package is installed.

     * Removed sudo stuff; users will have to run porthole as root for
       emerge functionality.

     * Added porthole.desktop menu entry.

     * Allow installing without an X server running.

     * Added options --fetchonly and --verbose.

     * There is an Upgradable Packages view. You can select packages
       to upgrade. Packages in the world file should be selected by
       default.

     * Icons for upgradable packages are no longer shown because it
       was too slow.

     * Settings and window positions are saved to $HOME/.porthole/prefs.
