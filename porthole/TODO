|                          TODO list for Porthole:                             |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Preferences Dialog:
      sync options (e.g. websync)
      default emerge options (e.g. verbose)
      archlist option (for advemerge and summary view)
      option to disable screensaver ? (RFE [1094373])
      Font and colour chooser for Terminal window ?
      use flag options ? 
      mirrors, proxies ?

 * Add right-click menu to summary view.
   Refine Package View right-click menu.

 * Allow multiple packages to be selected, then emerge in one line
   i.e. "emerge <package1> <package2> <package3>"
   (see RFE [974902])

 + (Done) Select All / None in upgradable view (RFE [939337])

 * Update statusbar to indicate that a search is taking place

 * Fix upgradable dependencies column (doesn't expand on first click)
   (This column might not be necessary if a "deep" option is available)
   (see below)

 / (Partially Done) Some sort of sudo functionality (RFE [950598, 1027080], Bug [1112449]).
   Perhaps using libgksu, libgksuui somehow (swig?).
   Pygksu is in gnome-python-extras cvs, but not ready for use (03 June 2005)

 * Manager for: (RFE [954349, 994537])
      use flags (make.conf)
      package.use
      package.unmask
      package.keywords
      mirrorselect
      http_proxy
   Viewer for:
      package.mask
   Perhaps some of this could be included in a preferences dialog

 + (Done) Reap zombie emerge processes (bug [1081506, 1119366])

 * Ability to unmerge certain version (e.g. only one slot) (bug [1082297]) using
   advemerge window. Could perhaps include this in summary view also.

 * Ability to save an emerge list and perform the emerge at a later date
   This could also be saved on disk before an emerge, to be resumed in the
   case of a crash.
   (see RFE [974902, 1081511, 1112457], bug [1112449, 1112459])

 * Add an option for "deep" dependency upgrading. Only show dependencies in
   upgrade view if this is enabled, and then select them by default ?
   (RFE [1013912])

 * Reinstate tree view with dependencies branching from world packages
   in upgradable view

 * Fix webbrowser choice, add "copy link" option in summary (bug [908237])
   Porthole needs to do more work to open the default browser.

 + (Done) Go back to selected category / package when changing views.

 * Method of faking or performing "ask" emerge - see what will be emerged
   then click "yes / no"

 * Allow the details for specific ebuilds to be viewed in the bottom pane
   (not just the default one)

 * Way of seeing what installed packages depend on a certain package.

 * Indication of unstable packages in package view (bug [1222366])

 * Show slots in summary view table

 + (mostly done) Table of available ebuilds in summary view

 ? Central database (perhaps persistant across sessions) of "Package" objects
   (i.e. don't keep them in TreeView objects)
   Perhaps check on startup to see if the portage database has changed since
   porthole was closed last, and update then (i.e. only when necessary).
   Porthole could keep track of changes while running, and thus wouldn't have
   to reload information so much.
   This could help for fast description searching (RFE [998428]), and would
   make Porthole a lot faster in general, but has the potential for lots
   of problems with discrepancies between Porthole and portage...
   perhaps use python fam interface.

 ? Advanced search criteria (masking, architectures, use flags)

 ? Possible "newuse" and "system" filters for upgrade list ?

 ? Somehow prompt to add packages to package.keywords if the user tries to
   merge a masked package (bug [1107532]). Check dependencies also.

 ? Ability to sort the PackageView by clicking on the headers of columns
   (e.g. sort by size)

 (Done) Something to show if we have run porthole as root or not (icon?).
   This will not be necessary when some sort of sudo functionality is
   worked out. (RFE [1181795, ?])

 ? Possible "uninstalled packages" view (bug [1078839])
 ? Show upgrade flags (B, NS etc.) in upgrade view (bug [1078839])

 ? Possibility to show info for packages in the emerge queue (right click ->
   select in packageview?) and to indicate queued packages in the packageview
   (Bug [1222366])

 ? Possible support for easy etc-update (RFE [954349])

 ? Distcc monitor ? (RFE [1071208])

Porthole Release Feature Schedule

Release 0.4.?

(done) - Updating the info for a selected package in a separate thread may make the gui more responsive
- Faster dependency calculations by only partially loading the tree
- USE flags & features editor(s) (being worked on)
- Look into caching the allnodes package list as portage-2.0.51 and newer no longer caches virtuals
- Remove the view selector and integrate them with the categories. 
(done?) Code the clipboard functions
(in progress) begin adding right click menus for many areas
- Make the package versions and use flags mouse & right click sensitive to bring up context sensitive
  menus for changing use flag status or displaying properties for different ebuilds, etc.
(in progress) Change the masked pversion display to indicate keyword masked/hard masked or /etc/portage.* listed

Release 0.5
- integrate portages new API into porthole replacing portaglib (when ready)
- A way to hide the details of an emerge and replace it with a pretty pulsing progressbar
- A porthole panel applet similar to redhat's up2date applet [maybe...]


==================================
Features for future consideration
==================================

- show dependacy use flags for a package as well as it's own 

- Make the package file list a filesystem tree, or a list of files.
  Double-clicking should open the file or folder in Nautilus.  It would be neat 
  if right-click brought up the standard Nautilus context menu.

(see above) Adding su ability inside porthole.  gksu now has the new API with  separate Libs for a gtk+ widget and core lib.
   It does not yet have a python interface.  I have been looking at using swig to create the python interface to the libs.

- Adding chroot ability to the terminal and mainwindow database.  This would allow porthole to
  be used for some install purposes.  Or help in using porthole to do remote work.

- Possibly re-write porthole terminal in c to fully integrate the vte terminal widget which will
  be able to do chroot & su easily. 

(see above) Advanced filter/search capabilities
  -- specific architecture
  -- stable/unstable
  -- use flag

(see above) Architecture Support Matrix.  List the versions down the side, architectures across
  the top, little icons for stable, unstable.  Possibly sticking with the format used
  by packages.gentoo.org

(done) Stable-unstable stuff for the "current" architecture was included in the summary 
  page.  Perhaps by color coding the version numbers.
 
(done) When pyGTK 2.4 becomes available & stable, switch to gtk.ComboBox instead of the 
  deprecated gtk.Combo
