Porthole Release Feature Schedule

Release 0.4
- Allow the user to select different ebuilds from a package
- Show ebuild source code
- Updating the info for a selected package in a separate thread may make the gui more responsive
- Faster dependency calculations by only partially loading the tree

Release 0.5
- USE flags editor
- A way to hide the details of an emerge and replace it with a pretty pulsing progressbar
- A porthole panel applet similar to redhat's up2date applet [maybe...]


==================================
Features for future consideration
==================================

- Make the package file list a filesystem tree, or a list of files.
  Double-clicking should open the file or folder in Nautilus.  It would be neat 
  if right-click brought up the standard Nautilus context menu.
