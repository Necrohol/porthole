Porthole Release Feature Schedule



Release 0.4.?

- Updating the info for a selected package in a separate thread may make the gui more responsive
- Faster dependency calculations by only partially loading the tree
- USE flags & features editor(s) (being worked on)
- Look into caching the allnodes package list as portage-2.0.51 and newer no longer cache virtuals
- Remove the view selector and integrate them with the categories. 
- Code the clipboard functions
- begin adding right click menus for many areas
- Make the package versions and use flags mouse & right click sensitive to bring up context sensitive
  menus for changing use flag status or displaying properties for different ebuilds, etc.
- Change the masked pversion display to indicate keyword masked/hard masked or /etc/portage.* listed

Release 0.5
- integrate portages new API into porthole replacing portaglib (when ready)
- A way to hide the details of an emerge and replace it with a pretty pulsing progressbar
- A porthole panel applet similar to redhat's up2date applet [maybe...]


==================================
Features for future consideration
==================================

- show dependacy use flags for a package as well as it's own 

- Make the package file list a filesystem tree, or a list of files.
  Double-clicking should open the file or folder in Nautilus.  It would be neat 
  if right-click brought up the standard Nautilus context menu.

- Adding su ability inside porthole.  gksu now has the new API with  separate Libs for a gtk+ widget and core lib.
   It does not yet have a python interface.  I have been looking at using swig to create the python interface to the libs.

- Adding chroot ability to the terminal and mainwindow database.  This would allow porthole to
  be used for some install purposes.  Or help in using porthole to do remote work.

- Possibly re-write porthole terminal in c to fully integrate the vte terminal widget which will
  be able to do chroot & su easily. 

- Advanced filter/search capabilities
  -- specific architecture
  -- stable/unstable
  -- use flag

- Architecture Support Matrix.  List the versions down the side, architectures across
  the top, little icons for stable, unstable.  Possibly sticking with the format used
  by packages.gentoo.org

- Stable-unstable stuff for the "current" architecture was included in the summary 
  page.  Perhaps by color coding the version numbers.
 
- When pyGTK 2.4 becomes available & stable, switch to gtk.ComboBox instead of the 
  deprecated gtk.Combo
