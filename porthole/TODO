Porthole Release Feature Schedule

Release 0.4
- Allow the user to select different ebuilds from a package
- Show ebuild source code
- Updating the info for a selected package in a separate thread may make the gui more responsive
- Faster dependency calculations by only partially loading the tree
- USE flags editor (possibly)
- change the mainwindow database reloads to the background and not collapse the views.
  Just update the view if needed.

Release 0.5
- integrate portages new API into porthole replacing portaglib (when ready)
- A way to hide the details of an emerge and replace it with a pretty pulsing progressbar
- A porthole panel applet similar to redhat's up2date applet [maybe...]


==================================
Features for future consideration
==================================

- Make the package file list a filesystem tree, or a list of files.
  Double-clicking should open the file or folder in Nautilus.  It would be neat 
  if right-click brought up the standard Nautilus context menu.

- Adding su ability inside porthole.

- Adding chroot ability to the terminal and mainwindow database.  This would allow porthole to
  be used for some install purposes.  Or help in using porthole to do remote work.

- Advanced filter/search capabilities
  -- specific architecture
  -- stable/unstable
  -- use flag

- Architecture Support Matrix.  List the versions down the side, architectures across
  the top, little icons for stable, unstable.  Possiblysticking with the format used
  by packages.gentoo.org

- Stable-unstable stuff for the "current" architecture was included in the summary 
  page.  Perhaps by color coding the version numbers.
