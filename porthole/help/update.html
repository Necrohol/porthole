<h1>Update Packages</h1>

<h2>Upgradable Packages</h2>
<p>To view the packages that you are able to upgrade, select the
"Upgradable Packages" view from the selector to the left of the search
bar. This will bring up a list of the packages where Portage's
recommended version differs from the currently installed version. Note
that if you have not selected "Upgradeonly" in the "Settings" menu,
this may also include packages that will be downgraded to a lower
version if they are selected.</p>
<p>If you are happy with the selection of packages to upgrade, clicking
the "Upgrade" button in the toolbar will add the selected
packages&nbsp;to the <a href="termwindow.html">Terminal Window</a> emerge queue, with appropriate emerge options.</p>
<p>By default, all packages in your "world" file (i.e. those you have
explicitly installed) will already be selected for you, while the
dependencies are not. clicking "Upgrade" with this selection would be
the same as running "emerge --update world". If you wish to select all
or none of the available packages, right-click somewhere in the package
list and choose "Select All" or "De-Select All".</p>
<h2>Advanced Upgrades</h2>
<p>If you just want to upgrade everything on your system, it is sometimes best to run a <a href="custcmd.html">custom command</a> in stead. Some possibilities are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">emerge --update world</span> - update all packages in your world file</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">emerge --update --deep world</span> - as above, but upgrade dependencies as well</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">emerge --update --deep --newuse world</span> - as above, but also recompile packages affected by any changes in use flag settings</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">emerge --update --deep --newuse --tree --pretend --verbose world</span>
- show everything that could be updated and what it depends on in a
nice organised tree, with details of use flags, versions and download
sizes, then calculate the expected amount of time it will take :).</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">emerge --update system</span> - update your system files</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ul>
