<h1>Custom Command</h1>
<h2>How to</h2>
<p>
This dialog interaction is for running emerge with options that are not yet
integrated into Porthole.  Some combinations of commands may never be fully
integrated into porthole's GUI interface, if at all.
</p>
<div class='warnleft'>
<b>Caution!</b> This dialog is capable of sending <b>any</b> command to porthole's terminal.
Porthole's terminal is a non-interactive terminal and as such will be incapable
of properly running some commands.
</div>
<p>
The dialog opens with a blank command entry box and a drop down history selector.
The first 6 entries in the history list are "persistent" ones that save you some typing.
All you need to do is select one, fill in any missing info to complete the command.
The remaining entries (if any) are the most recent history of commands actually run from the dialog.
Porthole will remember up to 10 unigue entries in total unless you edit your ~.porthole/prefs.xml file
