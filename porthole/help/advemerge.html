<h1>Advanced Emerge</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div class='warnleft'>
<b>Warning!</b> You can really screw up your system using advanced emerge
if the wrong version or settings are used!
</div>
<p>
As with all things technical, there is a deeper level of control afforded
by portage when it comes to installing packages.
 &nbsp;Setting use flags, accepting keywords and specifying certain
options during emerge allow the user to tailor and fine tune the 
system as well as override default installation behaviour.
</p>
<p>
The advanced emerge dialog can only emerge one package at a time.
</p>
<p>
The advanced emerge dialog is split into three basic sections: emerge
 options, package options and a button bar.
 &nbsp;The package options section is further divided into three sub-sections:
version list selector, use flags and keyword acceptor.
<h2>Emerge Options</h2>
<p>
The emerge options control emerge's behaviour when managing packages.
 &nbsp;The features of this section are:
<ul>
<li>Float over help for emerge options.
 &nbsp;This text is almost verbatim from the emerge help manual.
<li>Self deconflicting emerge options.
 &nbsp;When you select two options that conflict with each other, the
former is deselected automatically.
 &nbsp;E.G. if you select verbose, then quiet, verbose will
automatically be deselected.
<li>Emerge options selected in the main window settings menu are 
automatically set here. 
</ul>
<p>
Only the options that make sense for installing a package are listed.
 &nbsp;The options that assist in formatting output (e.g. --columns)
or displaying information
that Porthole already supplies (e.g. --changelog) were omitted 
to save space on the menu and make the interface as simple as
possible.
<p>
A good practice is to use pretend first if you are not sure of the
 results of your selected options.

<h2>Package Options</h2>
<div class='noteright'>
Note: Changing the version will change and reset the use flags and keyword
 to accept sections.
</div>
<h3>Version List</h3>
<p>
The version list is a drop-down select list containing all the different 
ebuilds for this package.
<div class='warnleft'>
<b>Warning!</b> The OLDEST version is selected by default; make sure
 you have the CORRECT version selected before executing! 
</div>
 &nbsp;The versions are sorted in release 
order<a href='#notes'><span class='note'>1</span></a> with the oldest
first and the most recent last.
 &nbsp;The default selection for the version selector is the oldest version.

</p>

<p>
The list also contains that versions' slot number and a flag if that
version is currently installed or it is the best/latest (preferred?) version.
</p>

<h3>Use Flags</h3>
<p>
Use flags customize what features are included with this package.
 &nbsp;In general, the more use flags selected, the more software
 will be installed.
 &nbsp;The use flags displayed are unique to the version selected
in the version drop-down list.
 &nbsp;The features of the use flag section are:
<ul>
<li>Float over help describing each use flag.
<li>Use flags set already by the system are marked with a plus sign (+).
 &nbsp;These flags are also initially selected.
<li>Use flags not set in the system are marked with minus sign (-).
<li>Both global and local flags are displayed.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Important:</b> Use flags are set in the command line according
 to the following rules:
</p>
<ol>
<li>If the use flag has a plus in front and you deselect it, a
 -<i>useflag</i> will be added to the emerge command, effectively reversing
your system default use flag setting.
<li>If the use flag has a minus in front and you select it, a
 +<i>useflag</i> will be added to the emerge command.
</ol>
<h3>Keyword to Accept</h3>
<p>
Keywords indicate which architecture is supported and whether the 
package is considered stable or not.
 &nbsp;Unstable packages are prefixed with a tilde (~).
 &nbsp;The keywords displayed are unique to the version selected
in the version drop-down list.
 &nbsp;The features for the keyword list are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Radio buttons to select which keyword to accept
<li>None selected by default
<li>Unmasked architectures listed for reference, but no
radio buttons are provided, since they don't need to 
be accepted if they are stable.
</ul>
<div class='tipright'>
<b>TIP:</b> Use the pretend option to test your settings before 
committing to an installation.
</div>
<h2>Buttons</h2>
<ul>
<li>Help - brings up this window
<li>Cancel - closes window without executing an emerge
<li>Execute - builds a command string based on the above settings
and submits it to the terminal window for execution.
</ul>


<hr>
<a name='notes'>Notes:</a>
<br>
<ol>
<li>We are somewhat at the mercy of the developers who seem to be able
to create new and increasingly difficult numbering schemes faster
than we can figure out how to sort them.
</ol>
