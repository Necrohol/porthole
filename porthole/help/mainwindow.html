<h1>Main Window</h1>

<h2>General Features</h2>
<p>
A word about GUI interfaces:  depending on the windowing system
and theme you have installed, the icons used by Porthole may differ 
radically from this help manual.
 &nbsp;So if the illustrations in this manual don't look EXACTLY like yours,
try to be open minded about it.
</p>

<p>
Some of the built-in features include:   
</p>
<ul>
<li>The tool bar can be moved out of the window using drag & drop.  
<li>The size of the panes are adjustable.
Just float your mouse over the dividing bar until the mouse pointer 
changes into the resize icon, then right click and drag the bar to resize it.
<li>Porthole will remember the size of your main window and 
the pane sizes between sessions.
<li>Tool tips.  Hover the mouse over a button or icon for a brief description.
</ul>
<p>
The main window is divided into a menu bar, a tool bar, package tree view,
 package list view and a tabbed package info. 
</p>

<h2>Menu Bar</h2>

<p>
The menu bar has three sub-menues: Action, Settings and Help.  
 &nbsp;Each menu item has a hot key combo to select it from the keyboard.
</p>

<h3>Action Menu</h3>

<div class='warnright'><b>Warning</b>: advanced emerge is just what it
 says--advanced!
 &nbsp;Resist the temptation to use this until you understand how portage works.
 &nbsp;Using the standard emerge will warn you if problems exist and
always install the best version.
</div>
<ul>
<li><u>Emerge Package</u> - Install/reinstall the selected package.
<li><u>Advanced Emerge Package</u> - Install/reinstall the selected package,
 but gives you fine-grained control of emerge options, 
use flags<a href='#notes'><span class='note'>1</span></a> and
 keywords<a href='#notes'><span class='note'>1</span></a>.
<li><u>Unmerge Package</u> - Uninstall the selected package.
<li><u>Sync Tree</u> - Sync the portage tree.
<li><u>Upgrade Packages</u> - Display a list of all packages that can be
 upgraded.
<li><u>Open Emerge Log</u> - Open an existing emerge log.
<li><u>Run Custom Command</u> - Run custom command.
<li><u>Quit</u> - Exit the program.
</ul>

<h3>Settings Menu</h3>

<ul>
<li><u>Pretend</u> - Prevents emerges and updates from installing
 and displays WHAT would have been installed only.
<li><u>Allow Downgrades</u> - Allows emerge and upgrade to install 
older versions,
 <i>if</i> the ebuild directs.
<li><u>Only Fetch</u> - Just downloads the files needed to install, but
does not actually install the package.
<li><u>Verbose</u> - Produce maximum output while emerging/unmerging.
<li><u>Search Descriptions</u> - Look through descriptions as well as names
 when searching for a package. 
</ul>

<h3>Help Menu</h3>

<ul>
<li><u>About</u> - Displays version, authors and links to home page
 and help system.
</ul>

</div>

<h2>Tool Bar</h2>

<div class='tipright'>
TIP! The toolbar has its short cut keys underlined--hold 
down the ALT key then press the short-cut key!
</div>
<p>
The tool bar provides an alternative to the menu bar
 and can save you a click or two.
</p> 
<ul>
<li>
<u>Emerge</u> - Same as Action menu Emerge Package.
<li>
<u>Adv Emerge</u> - Same as Action menu Advanced Emerge Package.
<li>
<u>Unmerge</u> - Same as Action menu Unmerge.
<li><u>Sync</u> - Same as Action menu Sync Tree.
<li><u>Upgrade</u> - Same as Action menu Upgrade Packages.
</ul>

<h2>View Selector</h2>

<p>
The view selector let's you choose between the following views:
</p>
<ul>
<li><u>All Packages</u> - Display all available packages in the tree view.
<li><u>Installed Packages</u> - Display only the packages installed on 
your system.
<li><u>Search Results</u> - Display the packages meeting your search criteria.
 &nbsp;In this view there is no treeview pane.
<li><u>Upgradable Packages</u> - Display only the packages that can be upgraded.
 &nbsp;In this view there is no treeview pane.
</ul>

<h2>Find</h2>

<div class='tipright'>
TIP! Setting &quot;Search descriptions&quot; on from the settings sub-menu 
 will include the package descriptions in the search too! 
</div> 
<p>
Enter a fragment of text in the input box next to the find button.
 &nbsp;Clicking the find button or pressing enter will start the search.
 &nbsp;The system will automatically switch to the Search results view 
when the search is complete.
 &nbsp;The search engine will find any occurrence of the selected text
 even if it is in the middle or end of a word.
</p>
<h2>Package Category Treeview Pane</h2>
<p>
This pane hold the portage library tree.  
 &nbsp;The categories and subcategories
are sorted alphabetically. 
 &nbsp;Clicking on the device beside the package category will expand the tree
to reveal the sub levels.
 &nbsp;Selecting the sub category will cause the package view pane to be populated
with the individual packages.
</p>

<h2>Package List Pane</h2>

<p>
In the All and Installed Packages views, the short name of the
 packages in the selected category is displayed.
 &nbsp;In the Search and Upgradable views, the full package name is displayed.
 &nbsp;The icon preceding the package name indicates it is currently installed.
 &nbsp;This icon is not shown in the Upgradable view because it 
must be installed to be upgradable.  
 &nbsp;Instead there is a checkbox so you can select which packages 
 you want to upgrade.
 &nbsp;The packages that are checked are ones in your /var/cache/edb/world file
(i.e. packages you explicitly emerged).
 &nbsp;It's the same list that would show up
when you run 'emerge -Up world' but it allows you to deselect ones you
don't need or want, and select other installed packages that aren't in
your world file (i.e. dependencies of those packages in the world file).
 &nbsp;Selecting all the packages in the upgrades list would be the equivalent
of running 'emerge -UDp world' 
</p>

<h2>Package Information</h2>

<h3>Summary Tab</h3>

<p>The summary tab gives you a quick overview of the selected packages latest
version only.
 &nbsp;Note this may vary from what you have installed or want installed.
The summary includes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Package full name (category and name).
<div class='tipright'>
TIP! Clicking the project URL will open that page in a browser.
</div>
<li>Package description provided by author(s).
<li>URL of the package project home page.
<li>Which version(s), if any, are installed in which slots.
<li>Which versions are available.
 &nbsp;Note: Versions in parenthesis are masked<a href='#notes'>
<span class='note'>1</span></a>.
<li>Which Use Flags the current package takes into consideration.
 &nbsp;The use flags you have set in your make.conf file are green and 
have a plus sign in front of them, those that don't; in red with a minus sign.
<li>Which license the package is distributed under.
</ul>

Figure 2. Dependencies Tab
</div>

<h3>Dependencies Tab</h3>

<p>
This tab lists a treeview of all the packages needed to build
 the selected package.
 &nbsp;Like the package list view, packages already
 installed have an icon beside them.
 &nbsp;Note that not all dependencies have to be installed 
for the package to work.
 &nbsp;Use flags play a big part in deciding what is or is not installed.
</p>
<div class='figright'>
<img src='changelog.png'>
<br>
Figure 3. Change Log Tab
</div>

<h3>Change Log</h3>

<p>
If available, the change log text is included in here.
 &nbsp;This is a good resource to use if you can't decide if you need to upgrade or not.
 &nbsp;Look here for information on bug fixes and new features.
</p>
<div class='figright'>
<img src='installedfiles.png'>
<br>
Figure 4. Installed Files Tab
</div>

<h3>Installed Files</h3>

<p>
A list of all the files this version installed.  
 &nbsp;This can be useful for a number of reasons.
 &nbsp;For example: the name of the executable binary file of that cool
sounding utility you just installed which is completely different
 from the package name and was not mentioned
 in the release notes.
