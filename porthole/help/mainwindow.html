<h2>General Features</h2>
<p>
A word about GUI interfaces:  depending on the windowing system
and theme you have installed, the icons used by Porthole may differ radically.
from this help manual.
So if the illustrations in this manual don't look EXACTLY like yours,
try to be open minded about it.
</p>

<p>
Some of the built-in features include:   
</p>
<ul>
<li>The tool bar can be moved out of the window using drag & drop.  
<li>The size of the panes are adjustable.
Just float your mouse over the dividing bar until the mouse pointer 
changes into the resize icon, then right click and drag the bar to resize it.
<li>Porthole will remember the size of your main window and 
the pane sizes between sessions.
<li>Tool tips.  Hover the mouse over a button or icon for a brief description.
</ul>
<p>
The main window is divided into a menu bar, a tool bar, package tree view,
 package list view and a tabbed package info. 
</p>
