Porthole 0.1 (Dec 15, 2003)
===========================

Porthole is a GTK-based frontend for Portage (the Gentoo package
management system, http://www.gentoo.org/). It features a hierarchial
view of packages and supports fast searches and dependency
calculations. Porthole also supports basic emerge features (emerge,
unmerge, sync, upgrade world).

Porthole is released under the GPL, see COPYING.

Porthole is partially based on an earlier program, called gportage
(http://www.stacken.kth.se/~foo/gentoo/), which has been discontinued
in favour of Porthole.

This is the initial release of Porthole. There is much room for
improvement, but we wanted to make a release before Christmas :-)
We absolutely _love_ bug reports! Please use the bugtracker at
SourceForge: http://sourceforge.net/projects/porthole/

= How to install Portole =
==========================

The easiest and recommended way of installing Porthole is by using the
ebuild that is available from the webpage. We assume you know how to
put ebuilds in the portage overlay. If not, please consult the
documentation and forums on the Gentoo web site (http://www.gentoo.org).

If you don't want to use the ebuild, you can download the tarball
(porthole-0.1.tar.bz2) and install it yourself. Porthole requires
PyGTK 2 and libglade 2 (and, of course, Portage).

> tar xvjf porthole-0.1.tar.bz2
> cd porthole-0.1
> python setup.py install


==============
= Using sudo =
==============

Porthole has the ability to let a normal (non-root) user emerge
packages using the sudo command. When using Porthole as a normal user,
Porthole will ask if you wish to use sudo. If you hit 'yes' Porthole
will use sudo to execute the emerge program.

The problem with this is that sudo must be set up to allow the user to
run the emerge program as root without entering a password. A simple
solution to this is to allow everyone in a specific group (in our
example I will use the portage group) access to run 'emerge' and such
without entering a password.

In order to set this up, here is what needs to be done:

- emerge sudo (if you haven't already)

- as root, run visudo

- add 'Cmnd_Alias PORTAGE=/usr/bin/emerge, /usr/sbin/ebuild,
  /usr/sbin/etc-update' to the file under the command alias
  specification

- add '%portage ALL = NOPASSWD: PORTAGE" to the bottom of the
  file. This will tell sudo that all users in the portage group are
  allowed to run the commands specified in PORTAGE without a password.

- save the file. Sudo should now be setup for all users in the portage
  group to emerge programs


====================
= Words of caution =
====================

It is currently possible to start more than one emerge
(emerge/unmerge/sync/upgrade) process simultaneously using
Porthole. DO NOT DO THIS! It may corrupt your installation! The same
rules apply when using Porthole as when using emerge as a command-line
tool. In future versions, we will not permit the user to do this.
