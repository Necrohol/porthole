Porthole 0.2 (Jan 30, 2004)
===========================

Porthole is a GTK-based frontend for Portage (the Gentoo package
management system, http://www.gentoo.org/). It features a hierarchial
view of packages and supports fast searches and dependency
calculations. Porthole also supports basic emerge features (emerge,
unmerge, sync, upgrade world).

Porthole is released under the GPL, see COPYING.

Porthole is partially based on an earlier program, called gportage
(http://www.stacken.kth.se/~foo/gentoo/), which has been discontinued
in favour of Porthole.

= How to install Portole =
==========================

The easiest and recommended way of installing Porthole is by using the
ebuild that is available from the webpage. We assume you know how to
put ebuilds in the portage overlay. If not, please consult the
documentation and forums on the Gentoo web site (http://www.gentoo.org).

If you don't want to use the ebuild, you can download the tarball
(porthole-0.2.tar.bz2) and install it yourself. Porthole requires
PyGTK 2 and libglade 2 (and, of course, Portage).

> tar xvjf porthole-0.2.tar.bz2
> cd porthole-0.2
> python setup.py install


====================
= Words of caution =
====================

It is currently possible to start more than one emerge
(emerge/unmerge/sync/upgrade) process simultaneously using
Porthole. DO NOT DO THIS! It may corrupt your installation! The same
rules apply when using Porthole as when using emerge as a command-line
tool. In future versions, we will not permit the user to do this.
